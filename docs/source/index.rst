Navigation
==========

Navigation subsystem is crucial for the rover to move around on the Martian surface while avoiding obstacles and reaching its destinations accurately. It typically consists of sensors, software, and algorithms for localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Key components include:

- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): Measures the rover's orientation and acceleration.
- Wheel Odometry: Tracks the rover's movement based on wheel rotations.
- Cameras: Used for visual odometry, terrain mapping, and hazard detection.
- LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): Provides detailed 3D maps of the terrain and detects obstacles.
- Star Trackers: Help in determining the rover's position by tracking the positions of stars.
- GPS (Global Positioning System): Assists in localization, although its use on Mars may be limited due to the lack of a global GPS network.

Drive Control
=============

Drive control subsystem manages the rover's mobility system, including motors, wheels, and actuators. It ensures precise control over the rover's movement and manages power distribution to the drive motors. Components include:

- Motor Controllers: Regulate the speed and direction of the drive motors.
- Wheel Assemblies: Includes motors, gears, and suspension for each wheel.
- Power Distribution System: Distributes power from the rover's batteries or solar panels to the drive motors.
- Drive Software: Controls motor movements, manages traction, and coordinates with the navigation system for planned routes.

Manipulation
============

The manipulation subsystem enables the rover to interact with its environment, such as collecting samples, deploying instruments, or performing repairs. Components typically include:

- Robotic Arm: Equipped with joints and end-effectors for manipulating objects.
- Instrument Deployments: Mechanisms for deploying scientific instruments, such as spectrometers or cameras.
- Sample Collection Tools: Scoops, drills, or coring mechanisms for collecting soil or rock samples.
- Tool and Payload Interface: Connects instruments and tools to the robotic arm securely.

Power Electronics
=================

Power electronics manage the generation, storage, and distribution of electrical power throughout the rover. Key components include:

- Solar Panels: Convert sunlight into electrical power for charging batteries.
- Battery Packs: Store electrical energy for use during periods of low sunlight or high power demand.
- Power Regulators and Converters: Ensure consistent voltage levels and convert between different power sources.
- Power Management System: Controls power flow to different subsystems, prioritizing critical functions and managing energy usage efficiently.

Communications
==============

Communications subsystem facilitates data exchange between the rover and Earth, as well as with other spacecraft or orbiters around Mars. Components include:

- Antennas: Transmit and receive data to and from Earth-based stations or orbiters.
- Transceivers: Convert data into radio signals for transmission and vice versa.
- Communication Protocols: Manage data transfer, error correction, and encryption.
- High-Gain and Low-Gain Antennas: Provide different levels of signal strength and coverage for various communication needs.
- Uplink and Downlink Systems: Manage the flow of data between the rover and ground control.

Chassis
=======

The chassis subsystem provides structural support for the rover's components and protects them from the harsh Martian environment. It also influences mobility and stability. Components include:

- Frame: Structural skeleton providing the base for mounting other subsystems.
- Wheels and Suspension: Designed for traversing uneven terrain and absorbing shocks.
- Thermal Insulation: Protects sensitive components from temperature extremes.
- Mechanical Interfaces: Attachment points for other subsystems and instruments.
- Dust Protection: Seals and filters to prevent dust ingress into sensitive components.
